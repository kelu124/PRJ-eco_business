## Funded companies

The companies who have received the most funding are Supersonic Imagine (general imaging), Butterfly Network (general imaging ), Delphinus (breast), U-Systems (breast) and Signostics (urology) [ref][Funding Analysis of Diagnostic Ultrasound Companies].
* Since 2010, 29 diagnostic ultrasound companies have secured external capital funding.
* There has been a lot of funding activity for companies developing ultrasound solutions for point of care applications, but the deal sizes tend to be smaller (average funding of $4.7M). The most funded are Clarius ($17.5M), Biim Ultrasound ($12M) and  eZono ($10M).
* The most recent venture-funded new market entrant is Clarius Mobile Health, with total funding to date of $17.5M. __Clarius is funded by  private investors and strategic partners, rather than venture capital__. 
* The last major exit by a venture - funded diagnostic ultrasound company was in 2013, when Zonare was acquired by Mindray for $102M
